====== Kit Examples ======

This package include examples for the EFM32GG_STK3700 Giant Gecko development
kit from Energy Micro.

====== Dependencies ======

This package _requires_ the EM_BSP_COMMON and EFM32 CMSIS packages to be
installed at the same level as this package. If you did not get this as part
of the Simplicity Studio application, you should also download and install the
EFM32 CMSIS package. See the Changes file for required version.

The CMSIS package requires C99 support, and so does this package.

====== File structure ======

kits/EFM32GG_STK3700/config

   and prototyping of EFM32 Giant Gecko software.
