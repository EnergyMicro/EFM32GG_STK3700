uC/OS-III RTOS on EFM32 using example.

This is a port of the uC/OS-III RTOS from Micrium Inc, http://www.micrium.com

The port has been adapted by Energy Micro for use with our Development Kit..
It requires the standard EFM32 CMSIS package (including emlib).

The example has three tasks:
 - Task1: LED blink task
 - Task2: Receives characters from serial port and posts message to Task3
 - Task3: Receives message from Task2 and writes it on LCD and serial port

Serial port can be chosen between:
USART1 - location 1 is used, GPIO port D pins 0 and 1, baudrate 115200-8-N-1.
LEUART0 - location 0 is used, GPIO port D pins 4 and 5, baudrate 9600-8-N-1.

These USARTs are by default not connected to any serial port, so this needs
to be connected to external RS232 ports to be usable.
