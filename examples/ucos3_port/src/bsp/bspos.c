*
* Description : Get current CPU timestamp timer count value.
*
* Argument(s) : none.
*
* Return(s)   : Timestamp timer count (see Notes #2a & #2b).
*
* Caller(s)   : CPU_TS_Init(),
*               CPU_TS_Get32(),
*               CPU_TS_Get64(),
*               CPU_IntDisMeasStart(),
*               CPU_IntDisMeasStop().
*
*               This function is an INTERNAL CPU module function & MUST be implemented by application/
*               BSP function(s) [see Note #1] but SHOULD NOT be called by application function(s).
*
* Note(s)     : (1) CPU_TS_TmrRd() is an application/BSP function that MUST be defined by the developer
*                   if either of the following CPU features is enabled :
*
*                   (a) CPU timestamps
*                   (b) CPU interrupts disabled time measurements
*
*                   See 'cpu_cfg.h  CPU TIMESTAMP CONFIGURATION  Note #1'
*                     & 'cpu_cfg.h  CPU INTERRUPTS DISABLED TIME MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION  Note #1a'.
*
*               (2) (a) Timer count values MUST be returned via word-size-configurable 'CPU_TS_TMR'
*                       data type.
*
*                       (1) If timer has more bits, truncate timer values' higher-order bits greater
*                           than the configured 'CPU_TS_TMR' timestamp timer data type word size.
*
*                       (2) Since the timer MUST NOT have less bits than the configured 'CPU_TS_TMR'
*                           timestamp timer data type word size; 'CPU_CFG_TS_TMR_SIZE' MUST be
*                           configured so that ALL bits in 'CPU_TS_TMR' data type are significant.
*
*                           In other words, if timer size is not a binary-multiple of 8-bit octets
*                           (e.g. 20-bits or even 24-bits), then the next lower, binary-multiple
*                           octet word size SHOULD be configured (e.g. to 16-bits).  However, the
*                           minimum supported word size for CPU timestamp timers is 8-bits.
*
*                       See also 'cpu_cfg.h   CPU TIMESTAMP CONFIGURATION  Note #2'
*                              & 'cpu_core.h  CPU TIMESTAMP DATA TYPES     Note #1'.
*
*                   (b) Timer SHOULD be an 'up'  counter whose values increase with each time count.
*
*                       (1) If timer is a 'down' counter whose values decrease with each time count,
*                           then the returned timer value MUST be ones-complemented.
*
*                   (c) (1) When applicable, the amount of time measured by CPU timestamps is
*                           calculated by either of the following equations :
*
*                           (A) Time measured  =  Number timer counts  *  Timer period
*
*                                   where
*
*                                       Number timer counts     Number of timer counts measured
*                                       Timer period            Timer's period in some units of
*                                                                   (fractional) seconds
*                                       Time measured           Amount of time measured, in same
*                                                                   units of (fractional) seconds
*                                                                   as the Timer period
*
*                                                  Number timer counts
*                           (B) Time measured  =  ---------------------
*                                                    Timer frequency
*
*                                   where
*
*                                       Number timer counts     Number of timer counts measured
*                                       Timer frequency         Timer's frequency in some units
*                                                                   of counts per second
*                                       Time measured           Amount of time measured, in seconds
*
*                       (2) Timer period SHOULD be less than the typical measured time but MUST be less
*                           than the maximum measured time; otherwise, timer resolution inadequate to
*                           measure desired times.
